# hello-world

Greetings, a Human here.
I'm testing GIT web interface using the GIT tutorial. It has some interesting features available but... I was expecting other instructions to manage my space through the terminal using git directly.
Anyway, it's good to have such experience in case I have to use a Windows machine.
